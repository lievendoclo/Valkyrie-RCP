This is the initial view for the application. It was configured in the
<tt>richclient-application-context.xml</tt> file with the <tt>lifecycleAdvisor.startingPageId</tt> property.
The source for this view is in <tt>InitialView.java</tt>.
</p><p>
This is a very simple view containing this text area and the label below.
The rest of the window layout (menus, toolbar, status bar, etc.) was created
by the platform from configuration information in the application context
and the <tt>commands-context.xml.</tt>
</p><p>
The text being displayed in this scroll pane and the text in the label at the bottom
of the view were configured in the application context as shown below.
The label text was specified using a message key, with a key of <tt>firstMessage.text</tt>
that was resolved by the messageSource from the <tt>messages.properties</tt> file.
All this configuration setup comes for free from the Spring platform.

So far, this view is all pretty much straight Swing, nothing to interesting.
To see a more complex view using more of the platform features, in the menus
above, select
<tt color=blue>Window&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Show&nbsp;View&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Contacts</tt>
</p><p>
This menu item was created automatically by the platform based on all the
views defined in the context.  Take a look at the class
<tt>org.springframework.richclient.command.support.ShowViewMenu</tt> to see
how it's done.
