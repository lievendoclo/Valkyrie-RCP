        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            Form component interceptors provide a way to intercept and add extra functionality to input components on a form.
        </para>
        <para>
            The application context specifies the list of interceptors to attach to controls constructed by the platform. This
            allows for a declarative model for specifying "additional" functionality to be added to various components.
        </para>
        <para>
            Examples are interceptors to overlay validation error images and background color changes, provide popup menus in
            text fields, and autocompletion (as you type) for comboboxes.
        </para>

    <section id="interceptors:create">
        <title>Creating your own interceptor</title>
        <para>
            To create your own <classname>FormComponentInterceptor</classname>, you have to provide both a FormComponentInterceptor and a
            <classname>FormComponentInterceptorFactory</classname> implementation.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public interface FormComponentInterceptor {
    public void processLabel(String propertyName, JComponent label);

    public void processComponent(String propertyName, JComponent component);
}]]></programlisting>

    <section id="interceptors:config">
        <title>Configuration</title>
        <para>
            The configuration of the interceptors in the application context is done by defining the
            <classname>FormComponentInterceptorFactory</classname> in the <literal>formComponentInterceptorFactory</literal> method.
        </para>
        <para>
            This is the standard configuration:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@Bean
public FormComponentInterceptorFactory formComponentInterceptorFactory() {
    ChainedInterceptorFactory factory = new ChainedInterceptorFactory();
    List<FormComponentInterceptorFactory> factories = Lists.newArrayList();
    factories.add(new ColorValidationInterceptorFactory());
    factories.add(new OverlayValidationInterceptorFactory());
    factories.add(new ShowCaptionInStatusBarInterceptorFactory());
    factories.add(new ShowDescriptionInStatusBarInterceptorFactory());
    factory.setInterceptorFactories(factories);

        <title>Built-in interceptors</title>
        <para>
            There are a number of built-in interceptors provided with the framework. We’ll quickly explain them.
        </para>

                This class has been specifically made to work with Valkyrie’s validation framework and will show the
                errors coming from that framework

                Adds more advanced text editing functionality to text components. It adds a popup menu with
                "undo/redo/cut/copy/paste/select all" items. It also adds the standard keyboard accelerators for these commands
                to the component.

                Shows an image in the top left corner of the component if the contents of the component has been changed by the
                user. The image also has a tooltip showing the original value. To the right of the image is a small revert
                button. Pushing this button restores the original value in the component

            <para>
                If the text is set in a text component, the caret position is set to the end of the text. This means the
                beginning of the text will not be visible if the text is too long to fit in the text component.
            </para>
            <para>
                This FormComponentInterceptor "fixes" this behavior, and sets the caret to position 0.
